                 To create an alarm, you must go to the My alarms section in the menu on the left and click the purple button. This will send you to a screen where you can
                  specify the time, snooze days, alarm message, and tone. \n By clicking on the button that appears, you can assign the alarm to a group.
                 If the group to which you want to add the alarm does not exist, by pressing Create Group you can create a group with the name you want. By doing this, your alarm will be created. \n
                  You can see your alarm from the default Clock application that comes with your mobile device from the factory, but it is recommended that you do not edit anything, since these changes will not be reflected in WakeApp. \n
                \n \n IMPORTANT \n \n
                - If you delete an alarm from the Clock factory application on your mobile device, you must also delete it from WakeApp, as it will continue to appear as existing. \n \n
                - You will not be able to create an alarm if you do not belong to an alarm group. \n \n
                - You cannot create two groups with the same name. \n \n
                - You cannot delete a group if it contains at least one alarm. \n \n</string>
